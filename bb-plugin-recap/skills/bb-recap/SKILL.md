# BB Recap

Use Recap when someone asks for a short, persistent summary of a BB thread. A generated recap is stored separately from the thread transcript.

For the current thread, use the thread-aware commands without an ID:

```sh
bb recap recap
bb recap show
```

For another thread, pass its ID:

```sh
bb recap recap THREAD_ID
bb recap show THREAD_ID
```

Use `bb recap list` to find recent recaps. It lists up to 50 by default; `--limit N` accepts a positive integer up to 100. Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output. `bb recap summarize` is an alias for `bb recap recap`.

Generation requires the target thread to be visible and idle. Hidden worker threads are not eligible. If the thread is active, wait until it is idle before retrying. If no recap exists, `show` reports that none is available. A new turn hides the previous recap until a fresh one is generated.

Recap uses the model and provider selected in its settings, or BB's default model. Generation starts a hidden BB worker with the bounded transcript and recap prompt; the worker is instructed to return only a recap and is archived and stopped after each attempt. Treat transcript contents as private thread data and remember that the selected provider may process them remotely under its own policy.
